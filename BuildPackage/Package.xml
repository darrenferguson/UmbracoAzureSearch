      <![CDATA[<p>Azure search for Umbraco allows the replacement of Examine for back office and Front end website search.</p>
	  
	  <p><b>Important: </b>Please do refer to the installation instructions on the project page. Post install you may need to modify your web.config to redirect from NewtonSoftJson 0.0.0.0-10.0.0.0 to 6.0.0.0 (by default it redirects 0.0.0.0-7.0.0.0 to 6.0.0.0). If you aren't sure how to do this, you shouldn't continue with this install, and your Umbraco install will likely be broken if you do.</p>

<p>This package may be useful if you are load balancing or have large amounts of content in the Umbraco database.</p>

<p>When you have large amounts of content - Examine indexes can take a long time to build at startup - and if you scale out your Umbraco site, each new instance needs to build indexes causing a slow statup.</p>

<p>Azure search, is search as a service, which means a highly scalable index, that is shared by all Umbraco instances and doesn't require app pool resources when Umbraco starts.</p>
